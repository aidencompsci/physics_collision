## Notes

```
python: 3.8.1
pygame: 1.9.6
numpy: 1.18.1
```

version 0 is where I finally got the physics actually working.
technically it is version 4, but we don't count those first ones :)

version 1 has simplified equation code a slight bit and added mass

potential future addons. of course who knows if I actually add them or not
- [ ] add a ball editor
- [ ] ability to save and load ball configs
- [ ] ability to apply a force to an object
- [ ] tada those features should be enough to make pool
- [ ] ???
- [ ] profit
- [ ] surely no one has made a pool game before, the market must be wide open
