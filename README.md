potential future addons. of course who knows if I actually add them or not
- [ ] add differing sizes and mass
- [ ] add a ball editor
- [ ] ability to save and load ball configs
- [ ] ability to apply a force to an object
- [ ] tada those features should be enough to make pool
- [ ] ???
- [ ] profit
- [ ] surely no one has made a pool game before, the market must be wide open
